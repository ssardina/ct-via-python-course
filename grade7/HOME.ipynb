    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this set of lessons we will introduce you to the wonderful universe of computational thinking, algorithms, and programming! \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first step is to build algorithms to control a little robot who needs to turn on lights. With this you are already solving problems computationally!\n",
    "2. We will then write or first program, the \"Hello World!\" program.\n",
    "3. After knowing how to print stuff, we will learn the first abstraction mechanism in computational thinking: _variables_ to store data.\n",
    "4. The next two notebooks will be devoted to study the two main mechanism to control the flow of a program: _conditionals_ and _repetitions_\n",
    "5. The next step is about the most basic, and still incredibely useful, data structure: _lists_.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach taken in this \"course\" is to learn computational thinking and problem solving by coding in Python, a very light, close to English, programming language. While computational/algorithmic thinking does not require coding itself (it can even be done without a computer!), coding is fun! And the more fun we have, the more time we invest, the more we learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the course, we will use [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/). A Jupyter Notebook is document that contains live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. A document is build of sequential cells, some are just text cells and some are interactive code cells. You can modify those cells and execute them. The result of an execution will be displayed just after the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explain how Jupyter notebooks are used in the first notebook using it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reference links\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some good tutorials and reference links on Python. We have sometimes taken from those tutorials and linked to them in a few places, but they can be done by themselves. Here are some:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Python Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/index.htm) at Tutorial Points. Reference guide: short, coincise, to the point.\n",
    "* [Interactive Python tutorial](https://www.learnpython.org/) at LearnPython.org.\n",

    "* An unambiguous specification of _how to solve a class of problems_.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important area of study is the development of algorithms and programs to \"move around\" intelligently in order to accomplish a task. For example, a GPS navigational algorithm is meant to produce (good) paths to move from an initial location to a given desired destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity we will build algorithms to _make our Lighbot robot navigate a maze and turn on lights!_ You need to arrange the commands that Lightbot robot must do (walk, turn, jump, switch on a light and so on) so that each maze is solved! \n",
