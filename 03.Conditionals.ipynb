We do not write a solution for just one special case (e.g, is the temperature 45 above the 30 threashold?) but for a family of possible problems (e.g., is the current temperature, stored in variable `temp`, above the 30 threashold?).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We have learnt about **complex conditions**. Python provides many arithmetic (e.g., `==` and `<=`) and logical boolean (e.g., `and` and `not`) [operators](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/operators), that can be used to write complex conditions. We will later see even more boolean operators. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. We have learnt how to **get input from the user**, via the `input(.)`. Together with the `print(.)` statement it provides interactivity with the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Finally, we have also seen how we can **combine strings and numbers** with commas in `print` statements, thus not needing to concatenate strings and convert numbers to strings via `str(.)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, so far we have dealt with variables containing one data. We have checked, for example, if a given number is even or the tens of a given number. But what if we want to check many numbers, say 20 numbers. Do we need to create 20 variables and corresponding code for each variable? That would hurt, woudln't it? Fortunately, no. We can do better and we will see that in our next notebook...\n",
