# Computational Thinking via Python Coding Course

## Overview

In this set of Python [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks we will introduce you to the wonderful universe of computational thinking, algorithms, and programming! 

1. The first step is to build algorithms to control a little robot who needs to turn on lights. With this you are already solving problems computationally!
2. We will then write or first program, the "Hello World!" program.
3. After knowing how to print stuff, we will learn the first abstraction mechanism in computational thinking: _variables_ to store data.
4. The next two notebooks will be devoted to study the two main mechanism to control the flow of a program: _conditionals_ and _repetitions_
5. The next step is about the most basic, and still incredibely useful, data structure: _lists_.

The approach taken in this "course" is to learn computational thinking and problem solving by coding in Python, a very light, close to English, programming language. While computational/algorithmic thinking does not require coding itself (it can even be done without a computer!), coding is fun! And the more fun we have, the more time we invest, the more we learn.

#### Reference links

There are some good tutorials and reference links on Python. We have sometimes taken from those tutorials and linked to them in a few places, but they can be done by themselves if wanted. Here are some good ones:

* [Python Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/index.htm) at Tutorial Points. Reference guide: short, coincise, to the point.
* [Interactive Python tutorial](https://www.learnpython.org/) at LearnPython.org.
* [Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_intro.asp) from w3schools. Tutorial around examples.
