    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a set of _interactive tutorials_ to introduce you to the wonderful universe of computational thinking, algorithms, and programming! \n",
    "\n",
    "1. We will start with some unplugged activities, where one can engange into computational thinking without computers!\n",
    "1. Then, we will build graphical algorithms to control a little robot who needs to turn on lights. With this you are already solving problems computationally!\n",
    "1. After that, we will write or first program, the \"Hello World!\" program!\n",
    "1. Knowing how to print stuff, we are ready to learn the first abstraction mechanism in computational thinking: _variables_ as a way to store data.\n",
    "1. The next two notebooks study the two main mechanism to control the flow of a program: _conditionals_ and _repetitions_\n",
    "1. The next step is about the most basic, and still incredibely useful, data structure: _lists_.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach taken in this \"course\" is to learn computational thinking and problem solving by coding in Python, a very light, close to English, programming language. While computational/algorithmic thinking does not require coding itself (it can even be done without a computer!), coding is fun! And the more fun we have, the more time we invest, the more we learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start, you may want to check [some intro slides about Computational Thinking](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19mLs-V3M3deozhNMw9YX9gKIxUaj2Reifv_DAIilmWA/edit?usp=sharing), and carry out the activities there.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the course, we will use [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/). A Jupyter Notebook is document that contains live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. A document is build of sequential cells, some are just text cells and some are interactive code cells. You can modify those cells and execute them. The result of an execution will be displayed just after the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explain how Jupyter notebooks are used in the first notebook using it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reference links\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some great resources online, to learn about Computation Thinking, Python, general programming, etc. The problem today is that there is probably _too much_, and thus it appears as an ocean of information!\n",
    "\n",
    "We list here some links that we believe are useful and from where we have shamelessly borrowed some ideas here and there, and added links to them in our notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python Resources\n",
    "\n",
