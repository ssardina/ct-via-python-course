    "\n",
    "There are some great resources online to learn about Computation Thinking, Python, general programming, etc. The problem today is that there is probably _too much_, and thus it appears as an ocean of information!\n",
    "\n",
    "So, here we present a set of gentle _interactive tutorials_ to introduce you to the wonderful universe of computational thinking, algorithms, and programming! \n",
    "\n",
    "The approach taken in this \"course\" is to **learn computational thinking** by coding in the **Python** programming language, a very light, close to English, programming language. While computational/algorithmic thinking does not require coding itself (it can even be done without a computer!), **coding is fun!** And the more fun we have, the more time we invest, the more we learn, easy...\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start, you may want to check [some intro slides about Computational Thinking](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MzSE8OkerVcT3slbuZhuRDPHc_nIEwcFEyS8_JH5TBg/edit#slide=id.g49563efb7a_0_0) to learn what is all this about..."

    "A document is build of a **sequence of cells**, some are just _text cells_ (just to read) and some are _interactive code cells_. You can modify those code cells and execute them, as many times as oyu want. The result of an execution will be displayed just after the cell.\n",
